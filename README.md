# API Generation Platform

## Overview
Our **API Generation Platform** empowers developers, businesses, and non-technical users to generate and deploy APIs by simply describing their requirements in plain English. Without needing to code or maintain backend services, users can access real-time data such as stock prices, weather updates, or sports scores within seconds.

## Problem Statement
Building APIs is often complex, time-consuming, and requires technical expertise. Many non-developers who want to create applications face barriers due to the lack of backend knowledge. Our platform simplifies this process, enabling anyone to access real-time data via APIs without writing a single line of code.

## How It Works
1. **User Prompt:** Users describe what kind of API they need in plain English.
2. **Prompt Interpretation:** Our AI models (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) interpret the prompt and generate backend logic automatically.
3. **API Generation:** The platform automatically generates and deploys the API on cloud servers.
4. **Instant Endpoint:** Users receive an API endpoint ready to be integrated into their applications.

### Example Prompt
"I need the latest NVIDIA stock prices updated every minute."
**Generated API Endpoint:** `https://api.example.com/stocks/nvidia/latest`

## Target Audience
- Developers who want to quickly access real-time data without writing backend code.
- Businesses seeking to automate data access without technical expertise.
- Non-technical users who want to integrate APIs into their applications without coding.
